# [67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/solutions/4264037/add-binary-python-easy-explanations/)

## Solution 1: Simulate Regrouping in Math

### Intuition

Carry out addition from right till left, with a carry variable to add.

### Approach

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to hold the answer.
1. Initialize `carry` as `0`, and `i` and `j` pointers to point to the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively.
1. Enter a `while` loop with condition `i >= 0` or `j >= 0` or `carry > 0`, and in each iteration:
   - Set `a_element` as `0` if `i` is out of bounds, else `int(a[i])`.
   - Set `b_element` as `0` if `j` is out of bounds, else `int(b[j])`.
   - Find `total` as the sum of `a_element`, `b_element`, and `carry`, and add it to `result` list.
   - Update `carry` to `0` if `total < 2` else `1`.
   - Decrement `i` and `j` by 1.
1. Finally, return the reversed of `result` as a joined string.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        result = []
        carry = 0
        i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1
        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry > 1:
            a_element = 0 if i < 0 else int(a[i])
            b_element = 0 if j < 0 else int(b[j])
            total = a_element + b_element + carry
            result.append(str(total % 2))
            carry = 0 if total < 2 else 1
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        return "".join(reversed(result))

```

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(\max(m, n))$

  - The number of iterations in the `while` loop is the maximum of the length of `a` denoted as `m` and the length of `b` denoted as `n`.
  - Reversing `result` takes a time equals to the length of `result` which is at most $\max(m, n) + 1 = O(\max(m, n))$.
  - Similarly, concatenating `result` list into a string also takes $O(\max(m, n))$ time.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(3\max(m, n)) = O(\max(m, n))$.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

  Since output `result` is not counted in space complexity, only constant space is used (3 variables required).

## Solution 2: Convert to Bits and Add

### Intuition

Convert both `a` and `b` into binary integers, add them bitwise and convert the result back to string.

### Approach

1. Convert `a` and `b` into binary integers.
1. Add them and return their result as a string.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        return format(int(a, 2) + int(b, 2), "b")

```

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(1)$

  Conversion and addition of two variables takes constant time.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

  No additional space is used.
