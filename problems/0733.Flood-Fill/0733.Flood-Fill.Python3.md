# [733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/solutions/4098937/flood-fill-python-easy-explanations/)

## Solution 1: Propagate with Depth-First Search

### Intuition

Visit the source pixel's neighbors with depth-first search if they have the same color as the source pixel and change the source pixel color to the new color.

### Approach

1. Define a recursive depth-first search function with `image`, `sr`, `sc` and `color` as input parameters.
1. In the recursive function:
   - Initialize `m` and `n` as the number of rows and columns in `image`.
   - Save the original source color as `source`, and change its color to `color`.
   - Define base case if `source == color`and return immediately.
   - Explore all 4 neighboring pixels (up, down, left and right) that are within bounds.
   - Call depth-first search recursively if they have the same value as `source`.
1. Invoke the depth-first search with `sr` and `sc` as the current input parameters.
1. Finally, return `image`.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.depthFirstSearch(image, sr, sc, color)
        return image

    def depthFirstSearch(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> None:
        m, n = len(image), len(image[0])
        image[sr][sc], source = color, image[sr][sc]
        if source == color: return
        for di, dj in [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]:  # up, down, left, right
            nr, nc = sr + di, sc + dj
            if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and image[nr][nc] == source:
                self.depthFirstSearch(image, nr, nc, color)
```

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(mn)$

  We need to search through all pixels in `image` in the worst case.

- Space complexity: $O(mn)$

  The recursive call stack requires a size that is proportional to the total number of pixels in `image`.

## Solution 1: Propagate with Breadth-First Search

### Intuition

Visit the source pixel's neighbors with breadth-first search if they have the same color as the source pixel and change the source pixel color to the new color.

### Approach

1. Initialize `m` and `n` as the number of rows and columns in `image`.
1. Initialize a queue with `(sr, sc)` in it.
1. Enter a while loop to apply breadth-first search while the queue is non-empty, and in each iteration:
   - Pop the queue to get the row and column indexes of the current pixel to be processed.
   - Ignore if the current pixel has the same color as `color`.
   - Else, save the original source color as `source`, and change the current pixel's color to `color`.
   - Explore all 4 neighboring pixels (up, down, left and right) within bounds.
   - Push the neighbor pixel's row and column indexes to the queue if they have the same value as `source`.
1. Finally, return `image`.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(image), len(image[0])
        queue = collections.deque([(sr, sc)])
        while len(queue) > 0:
            i, j = queue.popleft()
            if image[i][j] != color:
                source, image[i][j] = image[i][j], color
                for di, dj in [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]:  # up, down, left, right
                    nr, nc = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and image[nr][nc] == source:
                        queue.append((nr, nc))
        return image
```

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(mn)$

  We need to search through all pixels in `image` in the worst case.

- Space complexity: $O(mn)$

  The queue requires a size that is proportional to the total number of pixels in `image`.
