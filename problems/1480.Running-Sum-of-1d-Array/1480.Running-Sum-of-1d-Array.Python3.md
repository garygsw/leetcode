# [1480. Running Sum of 1d Array]()

## Solution 1: Brute Force Approach

### Intuition

Calculate the running sum for every position.

### Approach

1. Initialize list `result` as a copy of `nums`.
1. Iterate through `nums` with `i` as the index, and in each iteration:
   - Initialize a variable `total` as `0`.
   - Iterate through `nums` with `j` as the index until the `i + 1` position is reached, and increment `total` with `nums[j]`.
   - Update `result[i]` as `total`.
1. Finally, return `result`.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = nums.copy()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            total = 0
            for j in range(i + 1):
                total += nums[j]
            result[i] = total
        return result
```

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

  The total number of add operations in the double `for` loops is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n - 1 = O(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}) = O(n^2)`.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

  Since we do not count the output `result` into the space complexity, no additional space is required (only 2 index pointers used).

## Solution 2: Prefix Sum Array

### Intuition

The running cumulative sum of an array is also known as the prefix sum array, with each element as the sum of all previous elements.

### Approach

1. Initialize list `result` as a copy of `nums`.
1. Iterate over `nums` starting from index `i=1`, and in each iteration, update `result[i]` as the sum of the previous element `result[i-1]` and `nums[i]`.
1. Finally, return `result`.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = nums.copy()
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            result[i] = result[i-1] + nums[i]
        return result
```

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n)$

  A single pass `for` loop is used to iterate over `nums`.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

  Since we do not count the output `result` into the space complexity, no additional space is required (only 1 index pointer used).
