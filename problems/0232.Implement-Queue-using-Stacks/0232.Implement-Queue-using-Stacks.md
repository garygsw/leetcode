# [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/solutions/4119224/implement-queue-using-stacks-python-easy-explanations/)

## Solution 1: Two Stacks with Slow Push and Efficient Pop

### Intuition

Use two stacks to implement the queue with focus on making `pop()` efficient. The primary stack is used to hold all the items in the queue, with the top of the stack representing the next item to be popped, while the secondary stack acts like a temporary space to reverse the primary stack when we push a new incoming item.

To implement `push()`, we reverse the items in the primary stack by popping and pushing existing items from the primary stack into the secondary stack. Then we append the incoming item into the secondary stack and reverse the secondary stack again by popping and pushing the items from the secondary stack back into the primary stack. Although this makes `push()` slow, it allows us to implement `pop()` efficiently by just popping from the primary stack.

### Approach

1. Initialize two empty stacks in the constructor function, `s1` and `s2`.
1. Implement `push()`:
   - Pop and push each item from `s1` into `s2`.
   - Append the incoming element into `s2`.
   - Pop and push each item from `s2` into `s1`.
1. Implement `pop()` by popping the top element from `s1`.
1. Implement `peek()` by returning the top element in `s1`.
1. Implement `empty()` by returning `len(s1) == 0`.

### Code

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.s1 = []
        self.s2 = []

    def push(self, x):
        while self.s1: self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())
        self.s1.append(x)
        while self.s2: self.s1.append(self.s2.pop())

    def pop(self):
        return self.s1.pop()

    def peek(self):
        return self.s1[-1]

    def empty(self):
        return len(self.s1) == 0
```

### Complexity

- `push()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(n)$

    Each existing item in `s1` is popped and pushed twice, so total time complexity is $O(4n) = O(n)$.

  - Space complexity: $O(n)$

    For both stacks `s1` and `s2`, so total space complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

- `pop()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(1)$

    Popping the top of `s1` takes $O(1)$ time.

  - Space complexity: $O(n)$

    No additional space required.

- `peek()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(1)$

    Getting the top element of `s1` takes $O(1)$ time.

  - Space complexity: $O(1)$

    No additional space required.

- `empty()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(1)$

    Checking the length of `s1` takes $O(1)$ time.

  - Space complexity: $O(1)$

    No additional space required.

## Solution 2: Two Stacks with Efficient Push and Amortized $O(1)$ Pop

### Intuition

Use two stacks to implement the queue with focus on making `push()` more efficient and making `pop()` run at amortized constant time. The primary stack uses the top to represent the front of the queue, while the secondary stack uses the top to represent the end of the queue.

To implement `push()`, we just add the incoming element to the top of the primary stack. For `pop()`, first check if the secondary stack is empty. If so, reverse the primary stack by popping and pushing all the items from the primary stack into the secondary stack. Then just pop the top element from the secondary stack.

This helps to improve the amortized time complexity to constant time as the tedious step of reversing the stack is only performed once in a while when the secondary stack is empty.

### Approach

1. Initialize two empty stacks in the constructor function, `s1` and `s2`.
1. Implement `push()` by appending the incoming element to the top of `s1`.
1. Implement `peek()`:
   - If `s2` is empty, pop and push each element from `s1` into `s2`.
   - Return the top element in `s1`.
1. Implement `pop()`:
   - First call `peek()`.
   - Pop and return the top element from `s2`.
1. Implement `empty()` by returning `len(s1) + len(s1) == 0`.

### Code

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.s1 = []
        self.s2 = []

    def push(self, x):
        self.s1.append(x)

    def pop(self):
        self.peek()
        return self.s2.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if len(self.s2) == 0:
            while len(self.s1) > 0: self.s2.append(self.s1.pop())
        return self.s2[-1]

    def empty(self):
        return len(self.s1) + len(self.s2) == 0
```

### Complexity

- `push()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(1)$

    Pushing an item to the top of `s1` takes $O(1)$ time.

  - Space complexity: $O(1)$

    No additional space required.

- `pop()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(n)$, amortized $O(1)$.

    - See below analysis for `peek()`.
    - Popping the top of `s2` takes $O(1)$ time.

  - Space complexity: $O(n)$

    - See below analysis for `peek()`.
    - No additional space required for popping the top of `s2`.

- `peek()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(n)$, amortized $O(1)$.

    - In the worst case, each existing item in `s1` is popped and pushed once, so total time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.
    - Amortized analysis: Let us start with `s2` being empty and `s1` holding all $n$ elements. If we were to perform `pop()` $n$ times, we only need to reverse `s1` into `s2` in the first time, so the total time will be $O(2n + 1 + 1 + ... + 1) = O(n)$. Therefore, the amortized (averaged across $n$ operations) time complexity is $\frac{O(n)}{n} = O(1)$.

  - Space complexity: $O(n)$

    For both stacks `s1` and `s2`, so total space complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$.

- `empty()`:

  - Time complexity: $O(1)$

    Checking the total elements of `s1` and `s2` takes $O(1)$ time.

  - Space complexity: $O(1)$

    No additional space required.
